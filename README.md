# terraform-eks-works



It is a set of hands-on works which can simplify the infra engineers life.

This repo was thought to be a helpful hand in the work of devops engineers, exploring various features of EKS and terraform best practices. It aims to keep creating new ways to build a complete infra and automating it. 

It is an opensource project ready to take improvements and new ideas from community. So, pretty important topics will be discussed and implemented such as networking, security, observability, automation, CI/CD etc. Many other topics will be discussed and implemented using the very best practices and concepts used.

The terraform code used here intend to be reusable, scalable, testable, secure and well-documented.
